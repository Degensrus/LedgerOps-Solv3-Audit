# LedgerOps Security Assessment Report

This report presents the findings from a comprehensive security assessment conducted on Solve3 Finance's platform, encompassing the Solve3 Web Application, smart contracts, and their integration with the ORCA-SO Whirlpools framework. The assessment aimed to evaluate the platform's security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and provide actionable insights to mitigate potential risks. The engagement was performed by LedgerOps between January 6, 2025, and January 10, 2025, using a combination of automated tools and manual techniques.

## Scope of Testing

The security assessment covered the following components:

1. **Web Application**: Evaluation of Solve3â€™s user interface and API endpoints.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Assessment of critical functionalities, including vote escrow mechanisms (ve33), token management (Solve3), liquidity/swaps (Solve3fi), and token initialization (xSolve3), along with their integration with the ORCA-SO Whirlpools framework.
